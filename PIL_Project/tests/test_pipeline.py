# test_pipeline.py
"""
Smoke test for the Project Intelligence Layer (PIL) pipeline.

Validates that:
- The pipeline executes without error
- `entity_graph.json` is created
- At least one function node is present
- Required metadata fields exist on a sample node

This test does not validate semantic links or coverage logic â€” those are handled in their own modules.
