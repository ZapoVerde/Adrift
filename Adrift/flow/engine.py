# engine.py

"""
Main game loop and core flow controller.
This file orchestrates the high-level progression of gameplay phases:
- World entry
- Tactical exploration
- Combat resolution

‚öôÔ∏è Architectural Philosophy:
- `engine.py` defines flow, not logic.
- All calculations, rules, and simulation updates are offloaded to utils (e.g. combat_utils.py, player_utils.py).
- No embedded string output. All messaging routed through messaging.py or debug_utils.py.
- Tactical and world maps operate as separate layers: engine manages transitions.
- Designed to be modular, testable, and cleanly extensible.

üì¶ Current Flow Phases (subject to extension):
1. World Entry
2. Tactical Floorplan Load
3. Perception Pass
4. Initiative Queue
5. Actor Turns (player and AI)
6. Cleanup & Effects

This scaffolding will evolve with additional modules and rendering layers, but core responsibility remains orchestration only.
