# floorplan.py

"""
This module defines the Floorplan structure and creation utilities.
Floorplans are tactical maps composed of dict-based Tiles, each identified by (x, y).

Design Philosophy:
- Tiles are modeled as plain dictionaries to reduce overhead and increase flexibility.
- All relevant tile state is embedded explicitly for clarity and easier serialization.
- Floorplans are maps of arbitrary size, created dynamically as needed.
- This module avoids using classes or object methods to preserve modularity and data transparency.
- Commenting is exhaustive to support learning, maintainability, and extensibility.
