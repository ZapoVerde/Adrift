ðŸŽ¯ Mutation Rarity Weight Tables

Defines the probability distribution for technique evolution mutations.

Each mutation offer is generated by randomly selecting a rarity
from a weighted table. These weights are affected by the actorâ€™s
current *boost level* for the relevant skill.

Boosts are obtained by spending banked mutations. They increase
the quality of future mutation offers by excluding lower tiers
from the rarity pool.

ðŸ“Š Boost Level Effects:

| Boost Level | Eligible Rarities          |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| 0           | common, uncommon, rare, epic |
| 1           | uncommon, rare, epic         |
| 2           | rare, epic                   |
| 3+          | epic only                    |

Each rarity has a base weight representing its likelihood.

Note: These are NOT player-visible rarity drop rates; they are
internal tuning parameters for the mutation system.
