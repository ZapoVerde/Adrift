# ‚úÖ Actor Autonomy, Faction Dynamics, and Tactical Commands

This document summarizes all finalized, locked-in, or committed decisions made in the chat regarding actor behavior, faction interactions, and tactical command structures.

---

## üßç Player vs Actor Distinctions

- **No structural difference** is required between player and actors at base level.
- The game supports both **MC mode** (single-player-character) and **sandbox mode** (multiple controllable actors).
- MC mode implies **game over on MC death**.
- Sandbox mode may allow continued control across remaining actors.
- Differences emerge **only in UI, messaging, and input controller**.

---

## üß† Cognitive Load & Fog-of-War Visibility

- **Only the player** sees and controls tactical zone observation.
- AI actors do **not generate observation or fog-of-war updates** by default.
- Shared visibility is supported only via specific items **and** skill requirements.
- Example: Tech-based vision gear requires both equipment and relevant skill to contribute to shared vision.
- This prevents unearned perfect coordination without cost or tech justification.

---

## üê∂ Partial Control Actors

- Three classes of followers:
  1. **Allies** ‚Äì fight alongside you but are not commandable.
  2. **Followers** ‚Äì conditionally loyal, may refuse commands.
  3. **Low-cognition units** ‚Äì pets, robots; receive simple commands, act with autonomy.
- AI model should support **team-based tactics**, not bespoke per-follower logic.
- Controller modes: `human`, `ai`, `semi_autonomous`, `delegated`.

---

## üë§ MC vs No-MC Mode

- Explicit support for both playstyles:
  - **MC Mode**: player controls a named, central character. Game ends on death.
  - **No-MC Mode**: player may control multiple pawns. Game continues if one dies.
- MC mode requires:
  - `player_actor_id` to track the MC
- Sandbox mode requires:
  - `player_identity` object for global player-affiliated reputation

---

## üß≠ Faction-Based Reputation System

- No global fame or infamy metric.
- Actors log local events: e.g. ‚ÄúTimmy stole from Fred‚Äù
- Victim‚Äôs faction responds by increasing hostility **to actor's faction**
- Reputation propagates **through faction**, not world-wide memory.
- Local consequences, emergent diplomacy, and betrayal are all supported.

---

## üî• Faction Disavowal

- A faction may **disavow** or expel one of its members to de-escalate conflict with another faction.
- Triggered by:
  - Hostile event by actor
  - Victim faction power superiority
  - Faction diplomatic traits (e.g. low pride, high pragmatism)
- Actor receives `disavowed_by` tag.
- Dialogue, trust, and social access are all affected.
- Designed for systemic betrayal, outlaw gameplay, or emergent quests.

---

## üéØ Tactical Delegation MVP

- Delegation is scoped to **combat/tactical intent**, not job systems.
- Tasks are assigned via:
  ```python
  actor["current_task"] = {
      "type": "scout",
      "target_zone": "room_A",
      "fallback": {"type": "hold", "position": (3, 2)}
  }
  ```
- Supported tasks:
  - `scout`
  - `guard`
  - `follow`
  - `charge`
  - `hold`
  - `patrol` (looping optional, fallback supported)
- Delegated actors use `controller = delegated`
- Patrolling is a repeatable behavior, not a schedule
- All feedback routed through `messaging.py`

---

## ü™ì Explicitly Rejected or Deferred Systems

- ‚ùå Global fame/infamy
- ‚ùå Actor-to-actor gossip or automatic memory propagation
- ‚ùå RimWorld-style job tables or work priorities
- ‚ùå Full actor schedule logic (e.g. sleep/eat/work)
- ‚ùå Task queues (MVP only supports a single task)
