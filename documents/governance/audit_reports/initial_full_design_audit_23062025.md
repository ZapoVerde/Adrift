| 8         | Light Tier Visibility Model   | ✅     | ✅          | ✅ PER and env tested                |
| 9         | Environmental Visibility      | ✅     | ✅          | ✅ observe() includes penalty logic  |
| 10        | Messaging Architecture        | ✅     | ✅          | ✅ `messaging.py` enforced globally  |
| 11        | Equipment Stat Requirements   | ✅     | ❌          | ITEM_DB tags needed                 |

**Action Items:**
- Implement missing logic for:
  - Stat-modified equipment use
  - Inventory size enforcement
  - Action queue resolution and metadata
- Add tests for damage + targeting + failure modes
- Schedule next audit after 3 implementation milestones

**Auditor Notes:**
- No undocumented changes found.
- All changelog and delta logs up to date.
- Strong structural compliance, moderate implementation lag.
