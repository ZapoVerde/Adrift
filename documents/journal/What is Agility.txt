🩰 AGILITY (AGI) — SYSTEM DEFINITION
────────────────────────────────────

Stat Type: Physical
Soft Cap: 10 (human baseline), 20+ (augmented/post-human)
Primary Role: Governs an actor’s ability to control movement precisely, maintain reactive coordination, and adapt physically under pressure.

🧩 What AGI Is
AGI measures how well an actor can physically control their body in space — not just speed, but intentionality, recovery, and efficiency of motion. It enables the actor to:

Reposition smoothly or unpredictably

Maintain balance under unstable or chaotic conditions

React to threats before contact

Chain movements fluidly across terrain and obstacles

AGI models body intelligence — reflexive control, micro-adjustments, and real-time pathing decisions under duress.

📐 System Area Influence
AGI contributes to or governs systems in the following domains:

Traversal — deliberate, multi-tile movement

Avoidance — reflexive reaction to imminent threats

Stealth — reducing visibility through controlled movement

Control — stance stability, redirection, and impact mitigation

🧭 What AGI Is Not
AGI is not physical strength (see STR)

AGI is not perceptual acuity (see PER)

AGI is not decision-making or planning (see INT)

AGI is not willpower or emotional regulation (see RES)

AGI does not reduce damage — it prevents getting hit

🎯 Functional Summary
AGI determines:

How cleanly an actor moves through the world

How successfully they react to danger

How hard they are to lock onto or intercept

Whether they remain upright, efficient, and fluid — or stagger, flail, and get caught

This stat underpins most forms of physical self-management — from sprinting to slipping away.
