System: Skill & Mutation Framework

Change: Replaced “Mutation Banks” with Echoes
---------------------------------------------

- The global `mutation_bank` system is now renamed and restructured as Echoes.
- Echoes represent the residual potential from banked or rejected mutation offers.
- Echoes may be spent to:
  - Boost mutation rarity for a skill (3 Echoes)
  - Permanently improve a stat via Infusion (5 Echoes)
- Boosts apply per skill and may stack; Infusions are player-directed and permanent.
- Echoes are now earned at the same probability as skill level-up, not 2×.
- All existing documentation referencing “bank” must be updated to use “Echo” terminology.

Rationale
---------

- The previous "bank" terminology was mechanical and thematically disconnected.
- Echoes create narrative and symbolic meaning while preserving all mechanical functionality.
- Tying mutation frequency to level probability simplifies mental modeling and slows Echo inflation.
- The revised system ensures strategic pacing, clarity of purpose, and a unified growth model across combat, social, and stat domains.

Audit Note
----------

- Affected files:
  - technique_evolution_system.md: update all references to “bank” to “Echo” (e.g., mutation_bank → echo_count)
  - Game data structures: update all actor mutation-related fields
  - Messaging and UI systems: reinforce Echo theming in player-facing text

- System behavior remains unchanged except for adjusted mutation rate and renamed field.
- This change is cosmetic + economic, not structural.
