👁️ PERCEPTION (PER) — SYSTEM DEFINITION (SANITIZED)
────────────────────────────────────

Stat Type: Mental / Sensory
Soft Cap: 10 (human), 20+ (augmented)
Primary Role: Governs the maximum distance and visual clarity with which an actor can perceive external zones and objects under given lighting conditions.

🧩 What PER Is
PER is a range-limiting stat. It defines how far an actor is capable of seeing — assuming no obstacles, good light, and no interference. It does not control what is noticed or interpreted — only what is physically visible.

📐 System Area Influence
System Area	PER Role
Detection	Sets the upper bound for visible radius in clear conditions
Interpretation	Enables vague signals to resolve into readable detail
Avoidance	(Indirect) Supports earlier threat recognition

PER does not activate skills. It modifies what those skills have to work with.

⚙️ Interaction Summary
PER affects Range-of-Perception (RoP)

More PER = more tiles available for visual scan

Clarity is tiered: visible, vague, unseen

Visibility score is a function of:

Light level (light_tier)

Target size

Environmental effects (visibility_penalty)

PER stat of observer

PER does not allow an actor to notice, understand, or act on what they see.
That is the job of skills like observe, search, or analyze.

🔒 What PER Is Not
Not a detection skill

Not a memory stat

Not a substitute for observe or search

Not related to willpower or resistance

Not effective in zero-light conditions

👁️ PERCEPTION-RELATED SKILLS
────────────────────────────────────

Skill	Description	Primary Stat	Secondary Stat	System Area
Observe	Passive awareness of movement or threat nearby	PER/INS	Detection, Interpretation
Search	Active scan of a tile, container, or person for hidden detail	PER/INS	Detection
Track	Follow trail or pattern through terrain	PER	INT or RES	Detection, ProblemSolving
Spot Trap	Recognize hazardous components in a scene	PER	INT	Detection
Mark Target	Visually lock onto a target for tactical actions	PER	AGI or INT	Detection, Control

────────────────────────────────────
📐 Stat Role Model

Stat	Influence Type	Notes
PER	Primary	Drives raw visual reach and clarity
INS	Secondary	Helps interpret ambiguity
INT	Secondary (specific)	Supports logic-based searches
RES	Secondary (Tracking)	Persistence and focus under strain

────────────────────────────────────
🧠 Low-PER Behavior Modeling (Optional)

Skill	Low-PER Failure Effect
Observe	Misses silhouette, false “empty room”
Search	Overlooks hidden objects even when adjacent
Track	Loses trail on low-contrast surfaces
Spot Trap	Misclassifies object as harmless or natural
Mark Target	Locks on to wrong or decoy target

→ All failures are skill-level dependent, but amplified by low PER

You said:
lets redefine Observe and search to include their INS function too, and make INS an equal primary stat as discussed. 


ChatGPT said:
Excellent — here is the updated definition of observe and search, now fully aligned with your locked stat model:

PER and INS are both primary stats
→ PER = see clearly
→ INS = understand what you see

Both skills now require visual acuity and interpretive ability to function effectively — neither stat dominates alone.

🔍 observe — Skill Definition (Locked)
────────────────────────────────────

Role: Passive skill used to notice movement, activity, or subtle behavioral cues in nearby tiles.
It is triggered automatically during the perception phase and updated based on proximity, light, environmental modifiers, and movement.

Attribute	Value
Primary Stats	PER + INS (equal weighting)
System Areas	Detection, Interpretation
XP Trigger	Partial or full detection of entities under contested visibility conditions
Emerges When	Actor repeatedly notices movement, vague forms, or unidentified actors
Used Against	Actor stealth, light tier, visibility penalties
Fails When	Observer lacks visual clarity or misreads intent

Behavioral Notes:

High PER = wider scan radius

High INS = better interpretation of partial info

Skill becomes visible after a handful of close calls or partial detections

────────────────────────────────────
🔎 search — Skill Definition (Locked)
────────────────────────────────────

Role: Active skill used to scan a specific target tile, object, or actor for hidden presence, traps, or concealed clues.
It must be explicitly invoked, and temporarily boosts observe results for that tile.

Attribute	Value
Primary Stats	PER + INS (equal weighting)
System Area	Detection
XP Trigger	Actor successfully identifies hidden object, detail, or person in a searched tile
Emerges When	Actor initiates manual scans and achieves partial or full successes
Used Against	Concealment, stealth, embedded items, layered traps
Fails When	Actor sees but misclassifies, or overlooks entirely

Behavioral Notes:

PER controls surface awareness

INS governs pattern spotting and deduction

May return false positives or ghost readings under uncertainty (as per confusion matrix rule)
