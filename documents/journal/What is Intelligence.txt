Here’s your clear, modular definition for INT (Intelligence) — written in the same framing as Insight.

────────────────────────────────────
🧠 INTELLIGENCE (INT) — SYSTEM DEFINITION
────────────────────────────────────

Stat Type: Mental / Cognitive
Soft Cap: 10 (human), 20+ (augmented)
Primary Role: Manage complex systems, reason through logic, recognize patterns, and solve abstract or technical problems.

🧩 What INT Is
INT measures an actor’s cognitive complexity ceiling — their capacity for:

Abstract reasoning

Pattern analysis

Tactical planning

Codebreaking, logic chaining, technical operation

Efficient use of tools, systems, or environmental affordances

📐 Mechanical Effects
System Area	INT Role
Action resolution	Increases success odds for planning-, tool-, or logic-based tasks
Skill emergence	Accelerates discovery of multi-step or indirect-use skills
Technique gating	Allows use of logic-triggered or systems-level techniques (e.g., “Predict Attack Arc”)
Equipment interaction	Reduces error chance or action cost with advanced tools/devices

🧭 How INT Is Not Used
INT is not memory (though it can influence recall systems)

INT is not charisma or empathy (those live in Insight)

INT is not discipline or willpower (governed by Resolve)

INT does not generate options — it optimizes them

🎯 Narrative Function
A high-INT actor sees:

Invisible affordances — "you realize this cable bypasses the lock"

Causal links — "if she lied about her name, she’s lying about the rest"

Optimal order of operations — "shoot that support beam first"

Low-INT actors might succeed, but burn time, options, or clarity doing so.

🧠 INT-RELATED SKILLS (CORE SET)
────────────────────────────────────

Skill	Description	INT Influence
Hack	Interact with terminals, locks, or networks	Plan-efficient path through system logic
Tactics	Influence ally/AI behavior; optimize action economy	Predict outcomes, set formations
Analyze	Break down unknown tools, behaviors, or anomalies	Connect observation to unseen logic
Engineer	Construct or repair tech or structures	Correct tool selection, procedural order
Logic	Solve abstract or symbolic puzzles	Reduce input requirement, increase options
Recall	Retrieve learned or observed information	Reconstruct partial information accurately

These skills don’t all need to be MVP — but they define a mental gameplay domain distinct from Insight or Perception.

────────────────────────────────────
📈 INT as Primary or Secondary Stat

Skill	Primary Stat	Secondary Stat
Hack	INT	DEX
Tactics	INT	PER
Analyze	INT	INS
Engineer	INT	STR (manual leverage)
Logic	INT	—
Recall	INT	INS

────────────────────────────────────
🧠 Low-INT Behavior Modeling (Optional)

Skill	Low-INT Failure Example
Hack	Uses brute-force methods → lockout triggered
Tactics	Misreads threat priority → bad formation
Analyze	False positives (“this is a weapon” — it’s not)
Logic	Needs more hints to progress
Recall	Merges memories incorrectly or adds false detail

→ These can be flavor, fail states, or structural XP blockers
