PLAYER ALIGNMENT HANDLING
──────────────────────────────────────────────
STATUS: LOCKED
SCOPE: Applies to player character only; integrates with alignment\_mask\_persona.txt, interpersonal skills, and narrative output systems.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
PHILOSOPHY
──────────────────────────────────────────────
The player character has an internal alignment vector (empathy\_cruelty, order\_chaos, selfless\_selfish) just like all high-fidelity actors.

However, this alignment is:

* Never shown numerically
* Never scored as "good" or "evil"
* Never moralized by the game
* Never used to restrict options or coerce roleplay

> "Let the world read the player — not the player read themselves."

Alignment affects perception, not direction. NPCs interpret the player's actions through the lens of their own insight, strain, and worldview.

LEAKAGE MODEL
──────────────────────────────────────────────
The player's alignment leaks into the world like any other actor — but only if the surrounding actors are capable of noticing.

| Phase     | Behavior                                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Internal  | Player actions subtly shift alignment vector over time            |
| Mask      | If player maintains a persona, strain builds on contradiction     |
| Detection | High-INS NPCs roll checks to detect misalignment or cracks        |
| Reaction  | NPCs respond through narrative (suspicion, fear, trust, distance) |
| Mutation  | Skill offers may shift to match observed behavior patterns        |

Player leakage does *not* manifest as numbers, gauges, or flags. Instead, it appears as:

* Narrative descriptions (e.g. "He watches you a little too closely.")
* Changed tone or behavior from NPCs
* Technique reactions (e.g. failed persuasion due to lack of belief)
* Reputation shifts, rumor spread (if social memory systems are active)

──────────────────────────────────────────────
DESIGN COMMITMENTS
──────────────────────────────────────────────

* The game never says "You are becoming evil"
* Alignment is private unless inferred
* Leakage is continuous but interpretable
* Player has a mask, persona, and strain just like NPCs
* High INS actors can misread as well as understand
* Insight and related skills govern perception of player alignment

LEAKAGE TELLS (EXAMPLES)
──────────────────────────────────────────────

* "Your hand hesitates a moment too long before the trigger."
* "They flinch when you speak — they’ve seen what you did last night."
* "A child presses a flower into your hand. You did something kind… maybe."

These cues are soft, ambient, and narratively embedded.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
IMPLEMENTATION HOOKS
──────────────────────────────────────────────

* Player alignment: same 3-axis vector as other actors

* Mask: strain builds when acting against alignment or under scrutiny

* Leakage triggers:
  • Failing a mask roll while strained
  • Insight checks from NPCs
  • Social techniques targeting the player's mask

* Player can manage leakage using:
  • Social techniques (e.g. "False Calm")
  • Narrative deflection (e.g. "Joke to cover discomfort")
  • Skillful deception (e.g. "Reframe event through Perform")

──────────────────────────────────────────────
CONCLUSION
──────────────────────────────────────────────
The player has alignment. The world can read it. The player cannot.
There is no morality meter. Just consequences, interpretation, and tension.
