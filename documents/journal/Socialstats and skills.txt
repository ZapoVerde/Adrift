Section: Social Stats and Skills

Status
------

Finalizing the foundational structure for social stats and skills. This includes separating innate traits from trainable abilities and integrating them into the broader skill/technique/mutation framework. The model is compatible with Echo-based progression and the skill hierarchy used in combat and stealth.

Rationale
---------

- Avoids traditional “Charisma dump stat” pitfalls by converting it into a skill (Charm).
- Preserves player agency by tying growth to usage, not class or level-based upgrades.
- Keeps the stat system lightweight and complementary, not central or bloated.
- Mirrors physical systems: just as weapons train skills and mutate techniques, social skills now behave identically.
- Encourages tactical and narrative decisions in social encounters.

Core Structure
--------------

Stats (Innate, Passive Modifiers):
  - Insight: Read others; detect lies, intent, hesitation
  - Composure: Maintain control under pressure; resist influence

Skills (Trainable, Technique-Unlocking):
  - Charm: Persuasive warmth, likability
  - Deceive: Lies, misdirection, acting
  - Negotiate: Diplomacy, deal-making, compromise
  - Console: Emotional support, calming, empathy
  - Perform: Entertainment, distraction, manipulation
  - Intimidate: Threats, presence, force (optional inclusion)

Stats and skills are strictly separated: stats are **never trained directly**. Instead, repeated skill use leads to mutation chances, which may be banked or rejected to produce Echoes.

Stat Advancement Rules
----------------------

- 5 Echoes may be spent to perform a **Stat Infusion**, improving one stat of the player’s choice.
- Echoes are only earned by rejecting or banking mutation offers (not by leveling up directly).
- Echo frequency matches skill level-up probability and is no longer 2×.
- Echoes are tracked as `actor["echo_count"]`.

Architectural Implications
--------------------------

- Stats can now be used in roll modifiers, conditional logic, and gating systems (e.g., composure check to stay calm).
- Social techniques will mutate via the same flow and format as combat techniques, using the same component library.
- Echo system is unified across domains — no need to separate combat vs social logic.
- Mutation offers can draw from social technique components once defined.

Flow Integration
----------------

1. Skill-tagged social action (e.g., use Charm or Negotiate)
2. If successful and risky, XP is awarded
3. Roll for level-up and mutation trigger (same probability)
4. If mutation offer appears:
   - Choose: mutate, bank, or reject
   - Bank/reject generates 1 Echo
5. Echoes tracked globally per actor
6. Echoes may be spent on:
   - Boosting rarity for future mutation offers (3 Echoes)
   - Performing a stat infusion (5 Echoes)

Design Philosophy
-----------------

- Everything is earned through action and story.
- No player levels, no menu-based upgrades.
- Skills represent learned patterns; stats reflect persistent tendencies.
- Echoes give long-term agency without frontloading power.
- Mutation pacing and stat growth are intentionally slow, narrative-weighted, and meaningful.

Unstructured Notes
------------------

- Consider gating Intimidate skill behind faction origin or story background.
- Charm vs Deceive may eventually gain opposed techniques (e.g., “Heartfelt Appeal” vs “Feigned Sincerity”).
- Console skill may enable trauma recovery or prevent NPC breakdowns in extended encounters.
- Presence stat is explicitly excluded — its role is handled through skill results and narrative framing.
- Stat infusion messaging should use poetic, evocative language (e.g., “You feel a new calm settle into your bones”).
