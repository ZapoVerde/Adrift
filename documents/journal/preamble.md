## 📘 Design Journal

This document is the single source of truth for all locked-in game mechanics, architecture rules, and system designs.

### 🔐 What “Locked” Means

A `Locked` system is **finalized in terms of design**. It is:

* Fully specified with clear rationale
* Ready for implementation
* Not to be changed without:

  * Entry in the Design Changelog
  * Migration note in the Audit Journal

> 🔒 Lock does **not** mean the feature is implemented, tested, or complete — only that its design is stable and canonical.

### ✅ What “Implemented” Means

A `Implemented` system is:

* Fully coded in the correct module(s)
* Tested for core behavior and edge cases
* Confirmed via audit or MVP milestone sync

Each system may carry both `Locked` and `Implemented` flags.
