ALIGNMENT, MASK, AND PERSONA: SOCIAL STATE MODEL
──────────────────────────────────────────────

STATUS: LOCKED
SCOPE: Core simulation model — applies to all high-fidelity actors

This document defines how alignment, persona, and mask interact to drive social behavior,
emotional leakage, interpersonal tension, and traitor dynamics in Adrift. It integrates
with the interpersonal skills framework (Presence, Mask, Insight) and the strain system.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
I. COMPONENT DEFINITIONS
──────────────────────────────────────────────

1. ALIGNMENT (Private)
   - Stored as a vector of numeric axes:
       * empathy_cruelty      [-100 → +100]
       * order_chaos          [-100 → +100]
       * selfless_selfish     [-100 → +100]
   - Represents the actor's *true* behavioral tendencies
   - Not visible by default; inferred via behavior and Insight
   - Actors accumulate STRAIN when acting against alignment

2. PERSONA (Public)
   - Actor’s claimed self-image and role
   - Examples: “loyal protector”, “pragmatic raider”, “healer”
   - Defined via tags or labels at character creation or through faction rolecasting
   - Functions narratively but has mechanical tension with alignment

3. MASK (Emotional Control)
   - Stat representing an actor’s ability to suppress visible tension
   - High mask = stoic, unreadable
   - Low mask = leaks under stress
   - Damage to mask is temporary and accumulates with strain

4. INSIGHT (Perceptive Clarity)
   - Stat representing an observer’s ability to detect social contradictions
   - Enables noticing cracks in the mask or misalignment between actions and persona
   - Used passively and actively in techniques

5. STRAIN
   - Accumulates when actor is:
     • Forced to violate alignment
     • Denied a personal quest
     • Publicly challenged in persona
     • Operating under extreme social pressure
   - High strain reduces mask and increases leakage
   - Can lead to emotional breakdowns, social collapse, betrayal, etc.

II. LEAKAGE STATES
──────────────────────────────────────────────

Leakage occurs when mask fails to contain strain or alignment misfires.

Leakage triggers:
- Insight check succeeds against weakened mask
- Actor fails a Mask roll while strained
- A social technique forcibly reveals emotional state

Leakage outputs:
- Emoji indicators (“[strained]”, “[holding back tears]”, “[vacant stare]”)
- Dialogue hints (e.g. “She forces a smile, but it doesn’t reach her eyes.”)
- Technique activation failures (due to emotional state override)
- Party strain spikes or loyalty loss

Leakage can be *managed* through:
- Social support techniques (e.g. `Reassure`, `Redirect Attention`)
- Passive mask regeneration (rest, downtime)
- Techniques that suppress leakage temporarily (e.g. `False Calm`, `Poker Face`)

──────────────────────────────────────────────
III. TECHNIQUE INTERACTION
──────────────────────────────────────────────

Social techniques may:
- Force leakage in others (e.g. `Stare Down`, `Expose Hypocrisy`)
- Temporarily boost or suppress mask (e.g. `Steel Nerves`)
- Attempt to override persona (e.g. `Call Out`, `Break Cover`)
- Exploit known alignment (e.g. `Appeal to Mercy`, `Offer Order`)

Techniques always inherit one or more tagged skills from the actor.
Example: `Appeal to Mercy` might require:
  ["social", "influence", "persuasion", "emotional_appeal"]

Each technique has:
- An effect (what it changes)
- A modifier (scope, cost, delay, cooldown)
- A situational tag (when it's applicable)

Techniques are gained or mutated on successful skill use.
Each use rolls:
- P_adv = level-up chance
- P_tech = 2 × P_adv = technique gain chance
- P_mut = 2 × P_adv = mutation chance on owned techniques

IV. SOCIAL CONTRADICTION AND CONSEQUENCES
──────────────────────────────────────────────

When persona and alignment diverge under strain, the following may occur:
- Mask begins to crack (emoji projection, behavior shifts)
- Insightful party members detect tension or call out contradictions
- Strain increases rapidly if behavior persists
- Techniques may begin to backfire (e.g. `Inspire` fails if party no longer believes in actor)
- Personal quests may be unlocked or lost based on revealed alignment
- NPCs may challenge leadership or abandon actor
- Players may trigger internal quest arcs to reconcile or abandon a persona

──────────────────────────────────────────────
V. IMPLEMENTATION RULES
──────────────────────────────────────────────

- All high-fidelity actors must have:
    * alignment vector
    * declared persona
    * mask stat
    * strain value
- Insight and mask are standard stats
- Alignment is invisible to the player unless revealed
- Leakage outputs must route through messaging or animation layer
- Techniques must obey tagging, XP, and mutation protocols

──────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. FUTURE EXTENSIONS
──────────────────────────────────────────────

- Mask durability based on trauma history or background
- Persona evolution under duress
- Alignment-aware procedural quests
- Relationship tagging using alignment deltas
- Trait-based Insight detection modifiers (e.g. “Emotionally Aware”)
