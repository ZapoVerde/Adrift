At the end of each block will we have a functional unit that can be tested? At what point do we have a minimum spec MVP?

🧩 GOAL: Determine

Whether each block ends in a functionally testable unit

At what point the system reaches a Minimum Spec MVP — meaning:
• Autonomous simulation loop
• Player + actor actions
• World state changes over time
• Save/load supported
• Debug visibility of outcomes
• Spatial reasoning present, but not necessarily visual

✅ BLOCK REVIEW — TESTABILITY CHECKPOINTS
1. ✅ CORE GAME LOOP (Stages 0–6)
Includes: instrumentation, tick loop, actor lifecycle, actions, combat, effects

✔ Testable Output:

Fully deterministic tick loop

Actor tags → state gating

Wait + Move work

Combat hits → health loss → death

Poison or bleed drains health over time

All changes observable via debug() + logs

Systems communicate via EventBus

🎯 First major playable prototype — all logic is CLI-only but operational
🎯 Includes baseline debug, random control, scheduling

Checkpoint Result: FUNCTIONAL

2. ✅ MAP & TACTICS BLOCK (Stages 7–11)
Adds: ASCII map, zones, LoS, fog, cover, AI movement

✔ Testable Output:

Actor locations on tile grid

Fog visibility changes over time

Simple AI walks or attacks in LoS

Cover influences targeting resolution

All features validated visually in ASCII grid

🎯 Second major prototype — map-aware gameplay becomes possible
🎯 Tactical logic now traceable in real-time

Checkpoint Result: FUNCTIONAL

3. ✅ SYSTEM ATTACHMENTS (Stages 12–16)
Adds: skills, mutation, inventory, trading, social dialogue

✔ Testable Output:

Actors level up

Mutation offers trigger

Items added, traded, stacked

Simple conversations alter affinity

Quest chains simulate conditions

🎯 Expands gameplay, not required for core loop
🎯 All debug/testable via logs or CLI commands

Checkpoint Result: FUNCTIONAL

4. ✅ INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE (Stages 17–19)
Adds: save/load, tag match engine, governance tests

✔ Testable Output:

Save → quit → reload → same tick

Test coverage reports + debug trace checks

Static validation of tagging, adapter use

🎯 Enables safe iteration and replay tools
🎯 Provides test regression baseline

Checkpoint Result: FUNCTIONAL

5. ✅ WORLD SYSTEMS (Stages 20–21)
Adds: floorplan gen, population, faction matrix

✔ Testable Output:

Generated maps used in place of static ones

Actors placed via templates

Future quests and AI decisions read faction states

🎯 Required for scale and simulation
🎯 Doesn’t block core loop

Checkpoint Result: FUNCTIONAL

6. ✅ RENDERING & DEBUG (Stages 22–24)
Adds: sprite renderer, overlays, localization

✔ Testable Output:

Visual confirmation of tile states

Rendered fog, health, memory

Debug toggles for trace path

Player-readable messages

🎯 Not required for MVP gameplay
🎯 Required for polished product

Checkpoint Result: FUNCTIONAL (but not MVP-critical)

🧭 WHEN IS MVP ACHIEVED?
To define your Minimum Spec MVP, let’s apply your own constraints:

✔ Tick-based
✔ Actors can act
✔ Player interacts (even via CLI)
✔ Health + damage modeled
✔ Basic combat resolves
✔ Simulation observable
✔ Save/load possible
✔ World state includes positions (even if ASCII-only)

🧱 This is satisfied at the end of:

✅ Stage 11 – AI Behavior Dispatching
That’s the final step of the MAP & TACTICS BLOCK

📌 MINIMUM SPEC MVP = STAGES 0–11
Name: Deterministic Tactical CLI MVP
• Fully functional simulation
• Spatial rendering via ASCII
• Tactical movement, combat, death
• Simple AI + Event tracing
• Stateful, replayable, testable
