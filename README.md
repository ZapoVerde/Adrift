# Adrift

**Adrift** is a retro-sci-fi tactical dungeon crawler inspired by emergent storytelling systems like *RimWorld*, but built from the ground up as a standalone, original project. It features:

- 🎲 2d6-based tactical combat with probabilistic outcomes
- 🔍 Stealth, perception, and visibility mechanics
- 🧠 Actor memory and fog-of-war
- 🛠️ Mod-friendly item and skill frameworks
- 🌫️ Environmental visibility effects and destructible terrain
- 📜 Rich but player-driven narrative potential

> ⚠️ This is an original work, not affiliated with or endorsed by RimWorld or Ludeon Studios.

## 🔧 Development Philosophy

This project is:
- **MVP-driven:** Basic functionality first, polish later
- **Modular:** Logic is cleanly separated from flow and interface
- **Testable:** Utility functions and mechanics are isolated for coverage
- **Design-forward:** Concepts are documented in a living design journal
